This theorem states that the likelihood of an event occurring, given the occurrence of another event, is equal to the conditional probability of the second event given the first event, multiplied by the probability of the first event itself.\n",

Furthermore, let‚Äôs say that 0.2% of the sample population are people who actually have cancer. What's the probability of having cancer given a randomly chosen person tests positive?  Well let‚Äôs do the math!\n",

        "1. **Bernoulli:** The Bernoulli model is suitable when our feature vectors are binary, meaning they can only take two values (usually 0 and 1). In the context of text classification with a 'bag of words' model, the 1s represent \"word occurs in the document,\" and the 0s represent \"word does not occur in the document.\" This model is useful when we want to represent presence or absence of certain features in our data.\n",

        "2. **Gaussian:** In classification, Gaussian is a method that assumes the features we use to describe data (like measurements or characteristics) follow a normal distribution. This means that most of the data points cluster around the average value, and fewer data points deviate far from this average.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multinomial:** Multinomial is used when we are dealing with discrete counts. For example, in text classification, instead of just checking if a word occurs in a document (like in Bernoulli), we now count how many times a word appears in the document. It's like counting how many times a specific outcome (word) is observed over several trials (words in the document).\n",
